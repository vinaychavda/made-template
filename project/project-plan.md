# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
A Comparative Analysis of Country-Wise Population and Total Emissions.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Are there significant variations in emissions from various sectors across countries with different population densities?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Studying the relationship between a country's population and emissions from various sectors is of paramount importance. Emissions from sectors such as transportation, industry, and energy production significantly contribute to global environmental issues. As the world's population continues to grow, understanding the impact of these emissions becomes crucial for sustainable development.

This research is essential for informing policymakers and government bodies in designing effective regulations and incentives to mitigate emissions. It contributes to the broader goal of achieving environmental sustainability, guiding investments in cleaner technologies and sustainable practices. Additionally, it addresses public health concerns associated with high emission levels.

By analyzing the relationship between population density and emissions, this project aims to provide valuable insights that can contribute to global efforts to combat climate change and promote environmentally responsible practices.
